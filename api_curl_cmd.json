# Once the dispatch system has order lines and orders lists, 
# it will be able to start progressively marking these lines as 
# “processing” (status 20) or “sent” (status 30)
# We use numeric status codes because that is how we 
# defined them in the OrderLine model.
# Once all lines are marked as “sent” or “cancelled”,
# these lines will not be available in the 
# order lines list anymore
